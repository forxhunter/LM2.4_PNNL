                           Lattice Microbes 2.3.0 FAQ
================================================================================

1) Where can I find help?

Email the user mailing list: latticemicrobes-users@lists.illinois.edu



2) Can I contribute code to the project?

Sure, email the user mailing list to learn how.



3) The code compiles fine, but running a simulation causes the error: ""

In this case the Cuda code is not being compiled for you GPU's correct 
architecture.  Add the following to your "CUDA_FLAGS" in your local.mk file:

-gencode arch=compute_20,code=sm_20 \
-gencode arch=compute_30,code=sm_30 \
-gencode arch=compute_35,code=sm_35 



4) When compiling the code I get one of the errors: 
"identifier 'TUNE_MPD_Z_BLOCK_Z_SIZE' is undefined"
"identifier 'TUNE_MPD_Y_BLOCK_Y_SIZE' is undefined"
"identifier 'CUDA_3D_GRID_LAUNCH' is undefined"

These flags are required to set the optimal size for the memory on the GPU.
Fix by add the following to your "CUDA_FLAGS" in your local.mk file: 
-DCUDA_3D_GRID_LAUNCH \
-DCUDA_DOUBLE_PRECISION \
-DTUNE_MPD_Y_BLOCK_Y_SIZE=16 \
-DTUNE_MPD_Z_BLOCK_Z_SIZE=8


5) How do I support more than 64 reactions?

Add the compile time flag to your "CUDA_FLAGS":

-DGLOBAL_S_MATRIX

	MPD-RDME will place the S matrix and the RL matrix in device global memory
as opposed to storing them in constant memory.  The constant memory size
limitation allows us to have an S matrix of 16KB, which at 256 species is only
64 reactions.  Placing it in global memory allows "unbounded" size.  There is
still a 1536 reaction count limit due to other statically sized arrays stored
in constant memory.
