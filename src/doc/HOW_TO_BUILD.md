Building the documentation
==========================

Activate a virtual environment and install Lattice Microbes.
Then, install Sphinx and the Read The Docs theme

    pip install sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme

If `jLM-doc.ipynb` was modified run

    jupyter-nbconvert jLM-doc.ipynb \
        --to html \
        --execute \
        --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=300 \
        --output-dir=_static

to regenerate the example jLM notebook.  Although, there exists a package to
embed notebooks as Sphinx documentation, it does not work with the current
`_repr_html_` functionality. 

The LM C++ documentation is written in Doxygen, and can be imported into
docstrings in the Swig module. Run

    doxygen doxygen.swig.cf 
    python doxy2swig.py -f -w 192 xml/index.xml ../swig/documentation.i

to regenerate the docstrings. Then rebuild/install LM.

Finally run `make` to build the documentation

    make html

Sometimes modifications to the source are not picked up by make. In those
situations, the autogenerated files and the build should be removed

    rm -r _build _autosummary

The output will be in `_build/html`.
